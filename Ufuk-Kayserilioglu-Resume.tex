  \specialrule{.01em}{0.5em}{1em}

  \textsc{Aug 2011 - Mar 2013}  & Cofounded the company and assumed role as Managing Partner. In that role, my responsibilities were to get in touch with the local startup ecosystem, recruit promising startups into the accelerator programme, screen potential programme applications, make feasibility studies on candidate startups and make investment decisions. In addition to these management roles, I was also mentoring founders in the programme on topics ranging from lean startup methodologies to agile development and helping them with their investor pitches. \\
                                & \\
                                & As CTO of the incubator, I helped founders in the programme tackle programming challenges with hands-on coding sessions. For one startup (\href{http://www.bukacparaeder.com}{BuKacParaEder}) with no technical co-founder, I built the initial website from the ground up using Ruby on Rails. That particular website, an online antiques valuation site, was a fully operational internet services project complete with payment systems integration (PayPal and Virtual POS), mini CMS, PDF report generation and backend administrative management interface built in two languages (Turkish and English). \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

  \textsc{Mar 2013 - Present}   & After 6 startup investments, partners decided to pivot the business to incubating its own projects in house. The first (and current) project was to build an online insurance broker, \href{https://sigortaci123.com}{Sigortaci123}. Our observation was that competition in the local market were offering complex and confusing solutions and, most of the time, they were steering customers towards finalizing the transaction via a call-center operator. Our goal was to utilize technology as much as possible to discover information about the customer rather than asking and to provide a pleasant easy-to-use user interface that would steer them towards an online purchase. \\
                                & \\
                                & As CTO, I was responsible for getting in touch with the underwriting insurance companies to negotiate access to their web APIs, building a Ruby gem abstracting the APIs of different companies into a single unified interface and constructing a Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Angular website - both backend and frontend. It was decided that the project will have a different exact-match domain name for each insurance type, so the Motor Own Damage insurance is being hosted at \href{http://kasko123.com}{one domain} and the Third Party Compulsory Liability motor insurance is being hosted \href{http://trafik123.com}{at another}, all being operated by the same Rails application under the hood. \\
                                & \\
                                & The project has been open to public since the beginning of December with 4 insurance company integrations and is in public beta status. Since launch, we have recruited one junior Rails developer and we have been running A/B tests, analyzing the analytics reports, optimising the UI flow, implementing features to increase conversion, talking to customers online to better understand their needs and building integrations with more insurance companies. \\

  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

  \textsc{2002-2011}            & Initiated, and later on led, the development of PhonoClick Telephony Server; a C/C++ based, VoiceXML 2.0 compliant voice interaction system that works over POTS, ISDN and VoIP lines and is capable of utilizing ASR
                                and TTS resources in various languages. As the lead developer of the product, I was responsible for the architecture, design and implementation of all aspects of the system. Constantly communicated with the sales team about business requests and worked towards adding new requirements and features to the product, with a fast turn-around, to fulfill customer demand and in order to position it better in the market. The system was licensed to and installed at various customer locations such as Metis, Akbank, Finansbank, Garanti, Azercell. The project was funded by TUBITAK as part of the TEYDEB programme. \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

  \textsc{2004-2005}            & Designed and implemented the PhonoClick Conference Server (based on PhonoClick Telephony Server) and the first iteration of the teleconferencing application that was operated both as a hosted solution by the company and as an SaaS solution in collaboration with Turkcell. Implemented various novel extensions to the VoiceXML interpreter in order to implement the conferencing system, without breaking standards compliance. \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\


  \textsc{2005}                 & Designed and implemented the PhonoClick IP Call Center (based on PhonoClick Telephony Server) and worked on the first iteration of the ACD application package. The package provided customers with a web based console to define, administer and monitor operators, queues and calls; and, working in conjunction with PhonoClick IP Softphone, for the operators to answer (or, in some cases, initiate) calls. The system was installed at the Kamu Sertifikasyon Merkezi operated by TUBITAK in order to provide a suitable solution for their call center operation. \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\


  \textsc{2005-2006}            & Led the Hizli Basvuru Servisi (Fast Application Service) project that was primarily developed in collaboration with Akbank to streamline their credit application process and was later deployed to other leading banks in Turkey such as Finansbank. The project involved processing credit or credit card applications through an easy-to- use phone line service by providing first-in-class features such as integrating with SOA services to lookup and utilize personal information just by providing a Citizen ID Number and accepting natural speech inputs for other pieces of complex information. The system was integrated separately with the core banking systems of each bank to query and report application status and to provide feedback to the customer over various channels such as outbound phone calls and text messages. As project lead, I was responsible for outlining an architecture of the various components of the system, worked with colleagues in the implementation and was point man in technical communications between the company and the respective bank. \\
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\


  \textsc{2006-2008}            & Designed and implemented the initial version of the PhonoClick Automated Outbound Calling platform. The platform worked as a cloud SaaS solution that was responsible for receiving customer data (including cell phone numbers and various customer data relevant to the call) through online channels, such as FTP/SFTP/SCP file upload or file drops, SOAP based online API; placing outbound calls to those customers; collecting customer input; and providing detailed reports of call results and customer responses to the initiating party. The principle challenges of the platform were providing high availability, efficient load distribution and fast response times which were all satisfied. The project was funded by TUBITAK as part of the TEYDEB programme. \\
